# LFZ Co-Op

LFZ Co-Op is a full-stack application designed to streamline collaborative efforts, built with TypeScript, Express.js for the back end, and Tailwind CSS for the front end. It mimics the functions of an e-commerce website selling outdoor products. IT is my first full-stack project and first project using typescript. 
## Features

Full-Stack Architecture: Built using TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.

Backend: Developed with Express.js to handle routing and API calls efficiently.

Frontend: Styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development and a modern aesthetic.

Scalable Design: Designed to be extendable and maintainable for future enhancements.
